												At the <b>OU <strong>H</strong>uman-<strong>C</strong>omputer <strong>I</strong>nteraction and <strong>R</strong>ecommendation</b> (HCIR) Lab, we are working toward modeling and supporting people’s problem-solving and decision-making activities with intelligent information search and recommender systems, and understanding the economic, societal, and ethical impacts of advanced search and recommendation algorithms. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Our long-term<b>research goal</b> is to provide useful, timely, fair, and responsible information supports for people from diverse backgrounds and communities. Our methods include computational approaches such as data/text mining, deep learning, and natural language processing, as well as qualitative, participatory and user study research methods. Topics of interest include user biases in information interactions, intelligent information retrieval, bias-aware recommender systems, and adaptive information system evaluation.
											</p>
											<p>
												The <b>Principal Investigator</b>, <a href="https://jiqunl.github.io/me/", target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Jiqun Liu</strong></a>, started this lab in 2020. Dr. Liu is an interdisciplinary information science researcher by training, with research interests include information retrieval, recommender system, bounded rationality and ethics in human-computer interaction. Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cas/slis", target="_blank">School of Library and Information Studies</a>, <a href="https://www.ou.edu/", target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a>.

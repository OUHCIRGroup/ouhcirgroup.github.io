														<h3><strong>CRII:III: A bias-aware approach to modeling users in interactive information retrieval</strong></h3>
														<p>
														People often act intuitively and are subject to systematic biases when making decisions under uncertainty. The project seeks to study usersâ€™ systematic biases and leverage the learned knowledge in improving the explanatory and predicative power of IR models. The outcomes of this project can help people better leverage the power of information through 1) incorporating the knowledge about their biases into search algorithms, and 2) proactively capturing bias-related search problems and promoting informed, unbiased decision-making. The work is supported by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2106152&HistoricalAwards=false", target="_blank">NSF award</a>.

															<h3><strong>Reference-aware and usefulness-based click modeling</strong></h3>
															<p>
															Users are boundedly rational, and they areusually affected by cognitive biases when interacting with search results under uncertainty. This project aims to incorporate users' reference dependence bias into a novel click model. According to the behavioral economics research on reference dependence, people evaluate outcomes associated with actions based on gains and losses with respect to a reference point or expectation, rather than absolute final assets. This project will also explore the usefulness-based metrics to evaluate click models.

															<h3><strong>Session Level Evaluation Metric</strong></h3>
															<p>
															A search session is generally comprised of several queries trying to complete a particular search task. Each query is representative of the search state of the user involved in the search task. In this project, our focus is to go beyond the traditional query level evaluation metrics and make progress towards a more holistic evaluation metric that can represent both the user satisfaction and the relevance of the documents retrieved in a search session.

															<h3><strong>Interaction between Human and System biases in IR</strong></h3>
															<p>
															Humans have some form of biases and so does every system. In this project, we are trying to find out how the different human and system biases interact with each other. Also, how this affects the search results.
